        <dd>
            Any natural number n can be expressed as a
            product of prime factors, and that this decomposition
            is unique except for the order in which the factors
            are written.

        <dt>Common Multiple</dt>
        <dd>
            c is a common multiple of a and b if <em>both</em> a and b
            are factors of c
        </dd>
        <dt>Least Common Multiple</dt>
        <dd>
            c is the least common multiple of a and b if c
            is the smallest number that is a common multiple of a and b.
        </dd>
        <dd>
            To find the least common multiple of a and b, express them
            as a product of primes.  If a prime p appears n times in one
            number, and m times in the other; if n is greater than or
            equal to m (m may be zero), then p appears n times in the prime
            factorization of the least common multiple of a and b.

        <dt>Greatest Common Divisor</dt>
        <dd>c is the greatest common divisor of a and b if it is their largest common divisor.</dd>
        <dd>
            To find the greatest common divisor of a and b, express them
            as a product of primes.  If a prime p appears n times in one
            number, and m times in the other; if n is greater than or equal
            to m (m may be zero), then p appears m times in the prime
            factorization of the greatest common divisor.

        <dd>
            Let a be any positive number.  Then the absolute value of a,
            denoted as |a|, is defined as follows:
            <ul>
                <li>|a| = a</li>
                <li>|-a| = a</li>
