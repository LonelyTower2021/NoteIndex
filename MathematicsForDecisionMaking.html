            Prime factorization - Fundemental Theorem of Arithmetic
        </dt>
        <dd>
            Any natural number n can be expressed as a
            product of prime factors, and that this decomposition
            is unique except for the order in which the factors
            are written.

        <dt>Common Multiple</dt>
        <dd>
            c is a common multiple of a and b if <em>both</em> a and b
            are factors of c
        </dd>
        <dt>Least Common Multiple</dt>
        <dd>
            c is the least common multiple of a and b if c
            is the smallest number that is a common multiple of a and b.
        </dd>
        <dd>
            To find the least common multiple of a and b, express them
            as a product of primes.  If a prime p appears n times in one
            number, and m times in the other; if n is greater than or
            equal to m (m may be zero), then p appears n times in the prime
            factorization of the least common multiple of a and b.

        <dt>Greatest Common Divisor</dt>
        <dd>c is the greatest common divisor of a and b if it is their largest common divisor.</dd>
        <dd>
            To find the greatest common divisor of a and b, express them
            as a product of primes.  If a prime p appears n times in one
            number, and m times in the other; if n is greater than or equal
            to m (m may be zero), then p appears m times in the prime
            factorization of the greatest common divisor.

            Absolute Value
        </dt>
        <dd>
            Let a be any positive number.  Then the absolute value of a,
            denoted as |a|, is defined as follows:
            <ul>
                <li>|a| = a</li>
                <li>|-a| = a</li>
            </ul>
        </dd>

        <dt>Division</dt>
        <dd>Defined as the following: a / b = c if a = b * c</dd>
        <dd>Division by zero is undefined.  Using the previous definition
            of division, we see that: if a / 0 = c, then that would imply
            a = 0 * c -that there exists some integer c that when multiplied
            by 0 is equal to some integer a which is impossible.
        </dd>
        <dd>Dividing zero by zero is also is undefined. Using the definition
            of division: if 0 / 0 = c, then that implies that 0 = 0 * c which
            seems sane, except that c could be any number, and not just zero.
            0 / 0 = 17 would be true if we allowed this to happen.
        </dd>
        <dd>As such, one should never divide by zero (unless if they know
            what they're doing.)

        <dd>The term rational is more of a reference to 'ratio' than the
            number actually being rational.
        </dd>
        <dd>A fraction is said to be at its lowest terms when the
            numerator and denominator are considered to be relatively
            prime.
        </dd>
        <dd>The least common multiple between denominators is also
            considered as the lowest common denominator.
